        <div class="poem"> 
            <p>In the rift of battle, where champions clash,<br>
                Amidst the fray, there stands a man of gas,<br>
                A mad chemist, with laughter on his lips,<br>
                Singed, the one who leaves a trail of dips.</p>

            <p>He brews his potions, concocts his schemes,<br>
                And with a cackle, unleashes his dreams,<br>
                A poison cloud, that spreads and creeps,<br>
                His enemies caught, as they stumble and weep.</p>

            <p>With his flask, he lobs his deadly brew,<br>
                And the poison hits, burning through and through,<br>
                His laughter echoes, as he runs away,<br>
                Leaving behind, a trail of decay.</p>

            <p>But Singed is not one to shy away,<br>
                He charges in, with his fling and sway,<br>
                He's a master of chaos, a wild card,<br>
                And when he's on the field, expect the bizarre.</p>

            <p>His mind may be twisted, his motives unclear,<br>
                But one thing's for sure, he's a force to fear,<br>
                Singed, the chemist, the madman of the rift,<br>
                A champion who's impossible to predict.</p>
